Welcome to the Beginner's Guide to the UNIXverse workshop!
----------------------------------------------------------

This practical programming workshop aims to introduce useful programming tools
to the programmer. The workshop will cover useful UNIX filters, Regular
Expressions and Shell Scripting.

Attendees will take away a set of useful skills which can be used for any type
of programming in the future (especially on UNIX, the OS for real men (and
women)), including project work and programming competitions.  Stop living in a
shell and begin coding in one!
